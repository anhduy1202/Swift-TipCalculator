Submitted by: **Daniel Truong**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
- [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes
 
Some of the challenge I encoutered were I don't know anything about Swift yet, but it's kind of similar to JavaScript so I can pick it up easily, also I was having some trouble with 
dragging the UI components and it takes me a while to get used to that as well.
